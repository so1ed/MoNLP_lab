I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

I could run from it all, but I'd only get lost
Oh, I've walked on the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed
And I find myself a user
Oh, I wake every day with addictions to feed
They all call me a friend, but I'll never be freed
From the face of a faithless future

I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

These years pass by and we're growing older
And I think of you, all we've made it through
Some have passed away, some have moved on
But I'm still here today (I'm here today)

These years pass by and I am growing older
And I think of you and all we've made it through
Some have passed away, there's no words to say
No second tries, is this my life?
And I think of you

I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

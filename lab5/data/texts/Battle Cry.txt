Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I, I feel poisoned inside
But I, I feel so alive

Nobody can save me now
King is crowned
It's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now
It's do or die

Nobody can save me now
King is crowned
It's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now
It's do or die

Just one more time
Before I go, I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now

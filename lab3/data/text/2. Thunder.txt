\nKids were laughin' in my classes
\nWhile I was schemin' for the masses
\nWho do you think you are?
\nDreaming 'bout being a big star
\nThey say, \"You're basic,\" they say, \"You're easy\"
\nYou're always riding in the backseat
\nNow I'm smilin' from the stage while
\nYou were clappin' in the nosebleeds

\nThunder, feel the thunder (Never give up, never give up)

\nThunder, feel the thunder (Never give up, never give up)
\nLightning, then the thunder, thunder (Never give up on your dreams)

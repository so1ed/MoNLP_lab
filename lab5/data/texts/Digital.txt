I want a new world without the order
I wanna resurrect and live a little shorter
I want it heavy
I want the fury
I wanna beat it out the judge and the jury

From the outside, everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside
From the outside, everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside

We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change, we just want to change everything
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, digital, digital
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, digital heartbeat
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, digital, digital
We don't wanna change, we just want to change everything

I want a new world without the order
I wanna resurrect and live a little shorter
I want it heavy
I want the fury
I wanna beat it out the judge and the jury

From the outside, everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside
From the outside, everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside

We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change, we just want to change everything
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, digital, digital
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, digital heartbeat
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, digital, digital
We don't wanna change, we just want to change everything

And they been sayin', they been sayin' the same thing
And they, they been sayin', they been sayin' the same thing
And they, they been sayin', they been sayin' the same thing
And—they been sayin', they've been sayin' the same thing
And they, they been sayin', they been sayin' the same thing
And they, they been sayin', they been sayin' the same thing
They, they been sayin', they been sayin' the same thing
And they, they been sayin', they've been sayin' the same thing

We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change, we just want to change everything
Hey, hey, hey, hey, digital, digital

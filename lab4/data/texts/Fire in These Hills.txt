And I know you think about everything that I did wrong, but I do, too
Stayin' up these nights, drinkin' everything, I got nothing without you
I fear I might die alone
I fear I might knock and no one's home
Stayin' up these nights, thinkin' everything that I did wrong to you

I don't think that I'm strong enough
I'm never enough

'Cause there's fire in these hills
And I think I've lost the will
The more we try, the more we fail
But after everything, you're here with mе still
'Cause there's firе in these hills
And I think I've lost my will
The more we try, the more we fail
But after everything, you're here with me still

Gonna turn this car around, open up a sit-down, tell you all the truth
Gonna fade myself out, talkin' myself down, lightin' up this fuse
I fear I might wreck this home
I fear I might knock and no one comes
And I know you think about everything that I did wrong, but I do, too

I don't think that I'm strong enough

'Cause there's fire in these hills
And I think I've lost my will
The more we try, the more we fail
But after everything, you're here with me still
'Cause there's fire in these hills
And I think I've lost my will
The more we try, the more we fail
But after everything, you're here with me still

(The more we try, the—)
(I don't think that I'm enough)

I'm so tired, can I please come home?
I've run so far, can I, can I come home?
I'm so tired, can I please come home?
I've run so far, can I, can I come home?
I'm so tired, can I please come home?
I've run so far, can I, can I come home?

I'm so tired, can I please?

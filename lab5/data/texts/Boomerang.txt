'Cause I’m bad at lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Movin' on, movin' on
Movin' on, movin’ on
I’m ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You’re my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

How many tears do we have to cry?
How many sleepless, lonely nights?
To work it out, is it worth it now?
Should we go ahead or should we turn around?
I know I'll see you tomorrow

'Cause I’m bad at lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Movin' on, movin' on
Movin' on, movin' on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

Just because it isn't easy doesn't mean that it is wrong
Everything that we've been working on, working on so long
Ooh
You're my boomerang, boomerang (Ooh)
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boome-boome-boomerang-rang

Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Movin' on, movin' on (Boomerang-rang)
Movin' on, movin' on (Boomerang-rang)
Ready to go, ready to go (Boomerang-rang)
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Movin' on, movin' on (Boomerang-rang)
Movin' on, movin' on (Boomerang-rang)
Ready to go, ready to go (Boomerang-rang)
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

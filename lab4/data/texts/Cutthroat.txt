I'm so (Mis-) misunderstood (-un)
But I live for this (-der), my money's good (-stood)
And I came to win (Mis-), so step on up (-un)
And I promise you

Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat)
Only one of us
Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat)
Only one of us
Only one of us gon' make it out alive

I've been making my Gethsemane
Since I was young, my ancestry (Cutthroat)
Was marching martyrdom across the
Radadada dumbla plains of Utah (Cutthroat)
I can't lie, I've been played
By powerful pеople who get their way
But I, in timе, will climb my mountain
I, in time, will rise

I'm so (Mis-) misunderstood (-un)
But I live for this (-der), my money's good (-stood)
And I came to win (Mis-), so step on up (-un)
And I promise you

Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat)
Only one of us
Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat)
Only one of us
Only one of us gon' make it out alive

Try me!!
Try me!!
(Ra-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Cutthroat!!
Only one of us, only one of us, not you (Cutthroat)
Only one of us, only one of us
Only one of us
Get on my knee, get on my knee
Get on my knee, get on my knee
Get on my knee, get on my knee
Get on my knee, get on my knee
Cutthroat (Get on my knee)
Cutthroat (Get on my knee)
Cutthroat (Get-get-get, get-get-get)
Cutthroat

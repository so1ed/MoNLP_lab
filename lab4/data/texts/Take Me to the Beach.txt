I owe, oh-oh-oh
Nothin', not a penny, never wanna hear you preach
No, oh-oh-oh

(Take-take-take-take) Take me to the beach
Ah-ah-ah, you could have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, you take the snow
Ah-ah-ah, it's way too cold
My heart is cold enough
Ah-ah-ah, push comes to shove
Ah-ah-ah, you could have thе mountains
Ah-ah-ah, I'll take the beach

If you want it, comе and get it
Got a million people tellin' me they're with it
And they got me at my limit
And I'm tellin' you I never spare a minute
If you wanna keep on livin'
For the sucker that is tellin' you your limit
Gotta find out it's a gimmick
Can't nobody tell you how to live it

I owe, oh-oh-oh
Nothin', not a penny, never walkin' on a leash
No, oh-oh-oh

(Take-take-take-take) Take me to the beach
Ah-ah-ah, you could have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, you take the snow
Ah-ah-ah, it's way too cold
My heart is cold enough
Ah-ah-ah, push comes to shove
Ah-ah-ah, you could have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, I'll take the beach

I'm better off alone
Like a rollin' stone
Turnin' off my phone
No one bringin' me down, down, down, down  (T-A-K-E, T-A-K-E)
Just give me some space
That sun in my face
And the days go on, and on, and on, and on (T-A-K-E, T-A-K-E)

T-A-K-E, take me to the beach (Oh)
Ah-ah-ah, you could have the mountains (Have the mountains)
Ah-ah-ah, you take the snow
Ah-ah-ah, it's way too cold (It's way too cold)
My heart is cold enough (Oh)
Ah-ah-ah, push comes to shove
Ah-ah-ah, you could have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, I'll take the beach (I'll take the)
Take me to the (I'll take the)

I don't have no friends, ask anyone (I)
Got me 'til the end, my favorite one (Take me to the beach; don't, I'll take the)
I don't have no friends, ask anyone (Ask anyone; I)
Got me 'til the end, my favorite one (Take me to the beach)

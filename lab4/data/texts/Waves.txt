Took your freedom
There's no reason, just keep breathing
Time doesn't hear if you ask it to wait

La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
So own all your tears and just roll with the waves
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Life, it could change, it could change in a day
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
So cherish your years and just roll with the waves
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Time doesn't hear, so roll with the waves

Eleven years old, my only friend
You'd taken me in, but where was I?
When he took his life
Oh, I was singing in the prime of my life

Where was I when you were calling?
I can't go back
Time doesn't hear if you ask it to wait

La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
So own all your tears and just roll with the waves
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Life it could change, it could change in a day
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
So cherish your years and just roll with the waves
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Time doesn't hear, so roll with the waves

Ooh-ooh
Live in regret, or eye to the future?
I'd rather be here, thinking about the now
'Cause this breath could fade fast
And this day could be your last

La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
So own all your tears and just roll with the waves
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Life it could change, it could change in a day
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
So cherish your years and just roll with the waves
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Time doesn't hear, so roll with the waves

La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da

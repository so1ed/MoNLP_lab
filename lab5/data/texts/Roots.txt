Had to lose my way
To know which road to take
(Woah, woah, woah)
Trouble found me (Woah)
All I look for was
Washed away by a wave
(Woah, woah, woah)

I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots

I know it's gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me
I know it's gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots

Dull knives taking my life
A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind

A smoldering flame, deep in my heart
Barely a sign, it's barely a spark
Holding on through every night
Won't someonе please save my lifе?
I'm crying for help, it's such a cliché
Invisible pain, it's filling each day
I open my mouth and feed you a lie
Won't someone please save
My life is fleeting, no repeating

Dull knives taking my life
A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind

Dull knives ripping from the inside
Spare me the ride


From the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind
Dull knives

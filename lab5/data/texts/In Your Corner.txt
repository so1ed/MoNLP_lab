How can it feel so good and be so bad?
Misunderstood, and I can't take it back now
Just like I knew you would, you turn your back
And now we're here, and it fades to black

Tell me I'm right, tell me I'm wrong
But you know I've been here all along
In your corner
In your corner
Stayin' up late, playin' our song
You know I've been here all along
In your corner
In your corner

Ayy, ayy, yeah (Hold on, hold on)
(Keep your hands up)
Ayy, yeah (Hold on, hold on; alright, alright)
(Keep your hands up)

Gonna search this room 'til I find a pill
Gonna rinsе this down, everything I feel, alright
Tonight, alright
Gonna burn this down, evеry sober day
Gonna blow this out, throw it all away, alright
Alright, alright

How can it feel so good and be so bad?
Misunderstood, and I can't take it back now
Just like I knew you would, you turn your back
And now we're here, and it fades to black

Tell me I'm right, tell me I'm wrong
But you know I've been here all along
In your corner
In your corner
Stayin' up late, playin' our song
You know I've been here all along
In your corner
In your corner

Ayy, ayy, yeah (Hold on, hold on)
(Keep your hands up)
Ayy, yeah (Hold on, hold on; alright, alright)
Ayy, ayy, yeah (Hold on, hold on; get up, get up)
(Keep your hands up)
Ayy, yeah (Hold on, hold on; alright, alright)
(Your hands, keep up)

Tell me I'm right, tell me I'm wrong
But you know I've been here all along
In your corner (Get up, get up)
In your corner
Stayin' up late, playin' our song (Get up, get up)
You know I've been here all along
In your corner (Get up, get up)
In your corner

Ayy, ayy, yeah (Hold on, hold on)
(Keep your hands up)
Ayy, yeah (Get up; hold on, hold on; alright, alright)
Ayy, ayy, yeah (Get up, get up)
Ayy, yeah (Hold on, hold on)
(Your hands, keep up)

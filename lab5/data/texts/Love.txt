Where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?

All we see is faces, color, color
All the other races, other, other
Why can’t you just be my brother, brother?
We don't have to kill one another, kill one another
All around the world, we are one, we are one
All around the world, we are one

So where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love
(It’s darkest before the dawn)
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
(Love is our only hope)
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?

'Cause we got the same blood, blood
We got the same blood, blood
Will it be enough, 'nough?
Will it be enough?
We got the same heartbeat
We're living for the same dream
We got the same bloodstream
Where did we all go wrong?
Woo

Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love, love
(It’s darkest before the dawn)
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
(Love is our only hope)
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love, oh
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love

Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?
Where did we all, where did we all?
Where did we all, where did we all? (Oh)
Where did we all, where did we all?
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all?
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all?
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?

My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?

I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

Playin' with a stick of dynamitе
There was nevеr gray in black and white
There was never wrong till there was right (Ooh-ooh)
Feelin' like a boulder hurtlin'
Seein' all the vultures circlin'
Burnin' in the flames, I'm workin' in
Turnin' in a bed, that's darkenin'

My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?

I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (In my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

'Cause there's magic in my bones

Look in the mirror of my mind
Turnin' the pages of my life
Walkin' the path so many paced a million times
Drown out the voices in the air
Leavin' the ones that never cared
Pickin' the pieces up and buildin' to the sky

My patience is waning, is this entertaining?

I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones (Magic in my bones)
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (Soul)
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

There goes my mind, (I-I-I) don't mind
There goes my mind (There it goes, there it goes)
There goes my mind, (I-I-I) don't mind (There it goes)
There goes my mind (There it goes)
'Cause there's magic in my bones

Birds outside
Will sing me a song tonight
I know that it's right on time, time (Dwee-da-da-da)
Life flies by
The moon and the midnight sky
Is guidin' me to your side, side

I know that one day
I'll be that one thing
That makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day
The feel of a perfect wave
That's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day

Can we run away
To a place that children play
In the grassy fields, fields (Dwee-da-da-da)
I know they'rе tellin' you things that you put in your head, head
Promisе you that you are better off without them

I know that one day
I'll be that one thing
That makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day
The feel of a perfect wave
That's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day
One (One, one, one) day
I'll be that one (One) thing
That makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day (One, one)
The feel of a perfect wave
That's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
One day
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
One day

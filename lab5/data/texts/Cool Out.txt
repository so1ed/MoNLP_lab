Just before I go
Yes, I know that I'm losing control and
I want to take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control
I know I'm always pacing
And I blame it on the pressure I'm facing
I wanna take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control

I'm standing on your front porch saying, "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild saying, "Just go home," and

Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

You're always saying that you read my sign and
Always wishing that I take the time but
You know that's not my speed
Only believe what I can see
I live my life in black-and-white
I know that's not what you would like
That's all I know
I put my mind in cruise control

I'm standing on your front porch saying, "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild saying, "Just go home," and

Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out (Cool out)
So cool out (Cool out)

All the things that you detest in me
They keep you coming back for more, you see
We make each other get a bit crazy
But you will always be a part of me

Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

So cool out (Cool out, cool out)
Cool out (Cool out, cool out)
So cool out (Cool out, cool out)
(Cool out, cool out)

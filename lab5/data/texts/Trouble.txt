I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

So pray for me, brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me, sister, give me a mention
I got no faith, and oh, did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble

I'll pack it up, and hit the road
And only take my lighter
I've seen the glitz, I've seen the glam
But I prefer the pay dirt

I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

Pray for me brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me sister, give me a mention
I got no faith, and oh, did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble

Maybe you could save my soul
From all the things that I don't know
Maybe you could save my soul
From all the things that I don't know

Pray for me brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me sister, give me a mention
I got no faith, and oh, did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble

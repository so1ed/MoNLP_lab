I'm back from the dead, from the back of my head
Been gone and facin' horrors that should never be said
The wrath and the grit from the pit of despair
Been takin' every whip and word, I've never been spared

They say tomorrow's never promised, honest
They say that angels are among us

Lock me up in a maze (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
I was born, I was raised for this (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)
Lock me up inside a cage
Just throw away the key, don't worry 'bout me
I was drivin' in my car, throwin' up my hands, put it in coast

I could do this with my eyes closed
Turn out, turn out the lights
I could do this with my eyes closed
Turn out, turn out the lights
I could do this with my eyes closed

Less medications, less manifestations
Mantras, meditation, throw it all away
All the places I've been, all the blood that I've bled
I've been broken down and beat up but I still get ahead
All the faceless embraces and the tasteless two faces
Killed and resurrected 'cause I'll never be dead

They say tomorrow's never promised, honest
Yeah, they say piranhas are among us

Lock me up in a maze (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh)
I was born, I was raised for this (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)
Lock me up inside a cage
Just throw away the key, don't worry 'bout me
I was drivin' in my car, throwin' up my hands, put it in coast

I could do this with my eyes closed
Turn out, turn out the lights
I could do this with my eyes closed
Turn out, turn out the lights
I could, I could do this with my eyes—

And when the day broke, buried in violence
Somethin' made my mind up
I will spend these days as an island
Alone and far away

Lock me up in a maze (Oh, maze)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)
I was born, I was raised for this (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)
Lock me up inside a cage (Oh)
Just throw away the key, don't worry 'bout me
I was drivin' in my car, throwin' up my hands, put it in coast

I could do this with my eyes closed (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh)
I could do this with my eyes closed (Oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh)
I could, I could do this with my eyes closed
Turn out, turn out the lights
I could do this with my eyes closed
Turn out, turn out the lights
I could, I could do this with my eyes closed

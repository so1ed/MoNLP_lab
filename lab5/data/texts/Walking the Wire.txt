Oh, the storm is ragin' against us now (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

There's nights we had to just walk away (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up (Couldn't be, couldn't be)
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

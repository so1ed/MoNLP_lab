But I miss you when you're gone
And I know that life moves on
But I can't just replace you with this much regret
Please, don't forget about me

Just yet, don't forget me
Don't forget me
Just yet, don't forget me
Don't forget me

Remember when all that we had was your car?
Counting our quarters each night
Every day wanderin' towards our North Star
Guess we got lost in the light

But I miss you when you're gone
So I wrote you one last song
But I can't just replace you with this much regret
Please, don't forget about me

Just yet, don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (-get me)
Don't forget me
Just yet, don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (Promise me)
Don't forget me

Just yet
Even when it's gone
Can we just hold on?

After the years and the thousands of tears
Say it 'til nothin' is left
I won't forget you
I won't forget you

So don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (-get me)
Don't forget me (Don't forget)
Don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (Promise me)
Don't forget me
(Just yet) Askin' you (Don't for-), beggin' you (-get me)
Promise me, ooh (Don't forget me)
(Just yet) Askin' you (Don't for-), beggin' you (-get me)
Promise me, ooh (Don't forget me)

Just yet
Just yet

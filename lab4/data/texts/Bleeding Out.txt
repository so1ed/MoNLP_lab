When the day has come
That I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns grey
And everything is screamin'
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beatin'

Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleedin' out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I'm bleedin' out
I'm bleedin' out for you, for you

When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollerin'
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleedin' out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I'm bleedin' out
I'm bleedin' out for you, for you

(I'm bleedin' out for you, for you)
(I'm bleedin' out for you, for you)
(I'm bleedin' out for you, for you)
(I'm bleedin' out for you)

'Cause I'm bleedin' out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I'm bleedin' out
I'm bleedin' out for you, for you

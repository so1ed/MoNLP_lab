She said I can feel, I can feel too much
And I wish they'd go away, go away
’Cause it's crushing me, it's crushing me

Don't you know
That you don't have a say?
And the scarlet "A" on your neck
So pretty in red
Eyes are all dead
What they haven't said
Gets stuck in your head
The silence is deafening
And your heart is bleeding out
But they don't care
No, they never cared at all
No, they never cared at all
That's not who I am

She said I can feel, I can feel too much
And I wish they’d go away, go away
’Cause it's crushing me, crushing me
It’s crushing me, it's crushing me

She just wants to be free
Take it or leave it
Eyes, like the sunrise, colorful rainbow

She said I can feel, I can feel too much
And I wish it'd go away, go away
'Cause they’re crushing me
They're crushing me, oh
(I can feel, I can feel too much)
They're crushing me
(I can feel, I can feel too much)
Oh, they're crushing me
(I can feel, I can feel)

Crushing me
Crash down on me
Crash down on me

First comes a blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real

Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have's turning stale and it's cold
Oh, you'll no longer feel when your heart's turned to gold

Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

I'm dying to feel again
Oh, anything at all
But, oh, I feel nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

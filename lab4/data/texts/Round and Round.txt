You don't have to hold your head up high

Round and round, I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round, I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

We are afflicted by fiction, by fiction
Building a case for eviction, eviction
Circling (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Guarding a tower of ancients, of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience impatiently
Circling (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

You don't have to hold your head up high

Round and round, I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round, I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

All the emptiness inside you is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose, we're setting up to fail
You don't have to make it right
Just hold your head up high

Round and round, I won't run away this time (Hold your head up high)
Till you show me what this life is for (Hold your head up)
Round and round, I'm not gonna let you change my mind (Hold your head up high)
Till you show me what this life is for

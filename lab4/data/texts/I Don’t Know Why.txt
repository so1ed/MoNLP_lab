Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Dangerous
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Your love is always dangerous
Tell me that you love me

I don't know why

I don't know why (Ah)
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (To do with you)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (To do with you) (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

It's not a picture-perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line
I've got this place
That I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and
I'm hoping just to place
Oh, I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

Hey, Mr. Safe Man
Hustle me an okay
I could slide, take a dive
Take it for the home team
Hey, Mr. Post Man
Slip me one more green note
I've been low, hit the floor
Looking just to make broke

It's not a picture perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

I've got this place
That I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and
I'm hoping just to place
Oh, I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

Hey mister c-, Hey, hey mister, hey Mr. Cage Man
Cherry bomb (Margana na si ereht)
Let me ch-ch-ch cherry bomb
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch cherry bomb


I've got this place
That I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and
I'm hoping just to place
Oh, I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

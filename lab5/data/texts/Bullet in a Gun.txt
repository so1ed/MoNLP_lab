I'm high, then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Bullet in a gun (Bu-bu, hey), gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey), gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey)

To make a name, you pay the price
You give your life, no other way

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Bullet in a gun (Bu-bu, hey), gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey), gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey)

How many voices go unheard?
How many lessons never learned?
How many artists fear the light?
Fear the pain, go insane?
Lose your mind, lose yourself
(You only care about fame and wealth)
Sellout, sellout, sellout

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Like a bullet in a gun
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)

Bullet in a gun (Bu-bu, hey), gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey)

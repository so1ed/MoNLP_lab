You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

Oh-oh oh-oh oh
What is with you?
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
I've never seen this side of you
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
What is with you?
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
I've never seen this side of you (Hey!)

We are all living, till we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

I don't think it's quite the same
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay?

You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

Oh-oh oh-oh oh
What is with you?
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
I've never seen this side of you (Hey!)

We are all living, till we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

Oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh oh

Oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh oh (Margana on si ereht)
Oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh oh (Margana on si ereht)
Oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh oh (Margana on si ereht)
Oh, oh oh
Oh-oh, oh oh (Margana on si ereht)

We are all living, till we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

We are all living, till we grow older (Older, till we're older)
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier (Till we're older, till we're older)
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling (Till we're older, till we're older)
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling (Till we're older, till we're older)

(Older, till we're older)
(Till we're older, till we're older)
(Till we're older, till we're older)
(Till we're older, till we're older)
(Older, till we're older)
(Till we're older, till we're older)

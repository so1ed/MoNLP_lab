Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust

The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love

Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust


Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust

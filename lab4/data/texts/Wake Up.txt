Uh, turn around, turn it up
Talk a bit, zip it up
Lock you in, and close it up
Yup

Everybody's comin' for you, wake up
Everybody's comin', wake up
Bodies droppin' everywhere, I'm waist up
Everybody's comin', wake up

Some days, I'm a cha-chameleon
Switch it up when I crawl the ceilin'
Flip it upside down, I'm wheelin'
Dealin-in-in' (Dealin-in-in')
Every single one of you is comin' to my mind
Bring 'em all together, can you stack 'em in a line?
Jealousy is gonna be your failure, not mine
Winnin-in-in' (Winnin-in-in')

Uh, turn around, turn it up
Talk a bit, zip it up
Lock you in, and close it up (Up, up, up, up)
Oh!

Everybody's comin' for you, wake up (Wake up)
Everybody's comin', wake up
Bodies droppin' everywhere, I'm waist up (Waist up)
Everybody's comin', wake up

Everybody's comin', wake up

Got a case of the take-or-leave-it
Give an inch and I'm bound to seize it
Take a chainsaw out and feed it
Ring-dingin-in-in' (Ring-dingin-in-in')
Come alive when you don't believe it
Write me off, and I'd love to read it
Spit your words, and I'll watch you eat it
Diggin-in-in' (Diggin-in-in')
Oh!

Everybody's coming for you, wake up (Wake up)
Everybody's comin', wake up
Bodies droppin' everywhere, I'm waist up (Waist up)
Everybody's comin', wake up

Everybody's comin', wake up

What are you to do?
When they come for you
Winners hate to lose

Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughin' in my classes
While I was schemin' for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smilin' from the stage while
You were clappin' in the nosebleeds

Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder (Never give up, never give up)
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder (Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Never give up, never give up)
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder (Never give up on your dreams)

Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder (Woo)
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

I'm not gon' lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch?
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year
How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go, waitin' on a miracle
Guess that's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go

Sometimes I drive a little too fast
Think I'm runnin' from demons of my past
So I wrote a song to help me slow down
Keep my mind straight, but it's a bit late

I'm not gon' lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch?
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year
How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go, waitin' on a miracle
Guess that's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), waitin' on a miracle (Waitin' on a miracle)
Guess that's just the way it goes (Guess that's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), turn it down, and lay low (Lay low)
It's just the way it goes (It's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go

Remember when you got sick, cancer of the bone
Everyone in school while you're sittin' at home
In your wheelchair of grief, find no relief
We were there for the ups and downs and there for the constant rounds of chemo
Yeah, you know that you are our hero
You were there when I was a zero
And I swear I'll make things right before the long night
Swear I'll make things right tomorrow
But as for tonight

I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), waitin' on a miracle (Waitin' on a miracle)
Guess that's just the way it goes (Guess that's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), turn it down, and lay low (Lay low)
It's just the way it goes (It's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), waitin' on a miracle (Waitin' on a miracle)
Guess that's just the way it goes (Guess that's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), turn it down, and lay low (Lay low)
It's just the way it goes (It's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go

I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), waitin' on a miracle (Waitin' on a miracle)
Guess that's just the way it goes (Guess that's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), turn it down, and lay low (Lay low)
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go

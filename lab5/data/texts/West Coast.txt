I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one that keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the sun, I'll be the waves, I'll be the one you love the most

Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'll change my ways if you would stay
And all your tears that you have cried will go away
Oh, just grant me one more day
Oh, my love, please don't give up
See the Devil at my door
I see the future of the ones that I've ignored
I guess I was born to be at war
And, my love, I won't give up
So, my love, please don't give up

I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one who keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the sun, I'll be the waves, I'll be the one you love the most

Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey

Ooh, hey, hey, hey (Gonna give you that feeling)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey (Gonna give you that feeling)
Ooh, hey, hey, hey (Gonna give you that feeling)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey (Gonna give you that feeling)

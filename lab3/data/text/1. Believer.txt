First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second things second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

\nI was broken from a young age, taking my sulkin' to the masses
\nWriting my poems for the few that look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
\nSinging from heartache from the pain, taking my message from the veins
\nSpeaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the

\nPain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
\nPain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
\nPain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

\nAll the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh

\nBut they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
\nInhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
\nIt rained down like

\nPain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
\nMy life, my love, my drive, it came from
\nPain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
\n
\nLast things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
\nYou're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh

\nBut they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
\nInhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
\nIt rained down like
\n
\nPain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
\nPain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
\nPain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
\nMy life, my love, my drive, it came from
\nPain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

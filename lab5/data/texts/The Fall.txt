Maybe I'm broken, maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner than I should've
Only the good die old
That's what they told me, but I don't know, woah, oh-oh

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to the
Things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know, do you know
You're all I know? You're all I know?
When everything comes crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that I believed in to drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

Maybe I'm destined to be distraught
Always a reason, breaking me down to
My knees in the dead of night
I keep on praying to see the light, oh, oh-oh

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to the
Things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know, do you know
You're all I know? You're all I know?
When everything comes crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know (I'm ready to know)
Do you know, do you know (I'm ready to know)
You're all I know? You're all I know?
When everything comes crashing down (I'm ready to know, oh)
You're all I know, you're all I know

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that I believed in to drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away


You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
You were the one who helped me see (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
You were the one, you were the one (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, you gave it all to me  (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
You were the one, you were the one (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Do you know? Do you know?)
You were the one who helped me see (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(You're all I know, you're all I know)
You were the one, you were the one (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Do you know? Do you know?)
Oh, you gave it all to me (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(You're all I know, you're all I know)

I'm ready for the fall
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you, ooh

Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise
1-7-7-6, the names upon the list
Of all the ones who gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind and your mind will set you free

And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you, ooh

Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up (Lift me up)
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on


Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up (Lift me up)
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

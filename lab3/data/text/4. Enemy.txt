I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
\nFor my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
\nI'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
\nWhen my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned
\n
\nTell you you're the greatest
\nBut once you turn, they hate us
\n
\nOh, the misery
\nEverybody wants to be my enemy
\nSpare the sympathy
\nEverybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
\n(Look out for yourself)
\nMy enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
\n(Look out for yourself)
\nBut I'm ready
\n
\nYour words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
\nAnd the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
\nI stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
\nWhen I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
\n
\nTell you you're the greatest
\nBut once you turn, they hate us (Ha)
\n
\nOh, the misery
\nEverybody wants to be my enemy
\nSpare the sympathy
\nEverybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
\n(Look out for yourself)
\nMy enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look; yeah)
\n(Look out for yourself)
\n
\nUh, look, okay
\nI'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
\nI'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
\nI'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
\nBeing a wreck of emotions
\nReady to go whenever, just let me know
\nThe road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
\nThe enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
\nI'ma tell 'em, \"Hasta luego\"
\nThey wanna plot on my trot to the top
\nI been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
\nI blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
\nAnd it matters more because I had it not
\nHad I thought about wreaking havoc
\nOn an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
\nWith precision, I'm automatic quarterback
\nI ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
\nPack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
\nWho the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
\n
\nEverybody wants to be my enemy
\nSpare the sympathy (Ah)
\nEverybody wants to be my enemy
\nOh, the misery (Ah)
\nEverybody wants to be my enemy
\nSpare the sympathy (Ah)
\nEverybody wants to be my enemy
\n
\nPray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way
\nMy enemy
\nPray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint
\n(Look out for yourself)

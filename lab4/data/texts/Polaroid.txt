All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rollin' freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

I'm a hold my cards close
I'm a wreck what I love most
I'm a first class letdown
I'm a "shut up, sit down"

I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
And you are the pay raise
Always a touch out of view
And I am the color of boom

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
(But) never can fill the void

I'm a midnight talker
Oh, I'm an alley walker
I'm a day late two-face
I'm a burn out quick pace

I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
And you are the opera
Always on time and in tune
And I am the color of boom

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
(But) never can fill the void

I'm gonna get ready
For the rain to pour heavy
Let it fall, fall
Let it fall upon my head

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
(But) never can fill the void

Oh, love is a polaroid
Oh, love is a polaroid
(Oh-a-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-a-oh, oh-a-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-a-oh)
Oh, love is a polaroid
(Oh-a-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-a-oh)
Love is a polaroid

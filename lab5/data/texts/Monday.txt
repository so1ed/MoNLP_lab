I believe (I believe) in the cause (In the cause)
I'm pound-for-pound, baby, turn it on
A million calls will never do, I never get enough of you
I never get enough of you

You are my Monday, you're the best day of the week
So underrated and a brand new start
Don't care what all the kids say
You've got the key to my heart, ooh

When you call (When you call) on the phone (On the phone)
I never let you hear the dial tone (Ring)
I believe (I believe) in your touch (In your touch)
I know I can be a little much
I'm there for you
Will you be there for me, too? Ooh

You are my Monday (You are my Monday), you're the best day of the week (Best day of the week)
So underrated (So underrated) and a brand new start (Brand new start)
Don't care what all the kids say (Never care)
You've got the key to my heart, ooh


You could be the one that I've been waiting all my life for
You could be the key to lead me up into the highest floor
Give me lovin', keep me goin' 'til the midnight hour
Bring me up, lift me up to your rainbow tower
Your rainbow tower
My Monday, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Monday, my, my Monday)
My Monday
My Monday, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no, day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said—

Sometimes, I smile to keep things easy
I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me

So I'm playin' the role, ridin' the bull, stuck in a hole
Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life, oh-oh

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

I said, "Oh, love" (Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
Have mercy (Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
Oh, love, can you please have mercy on me? (Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
Can you keep me company? (Help keep me company, I said, help)
L-O-N-E-L-Why am I so lonely?

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
(Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
(Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
I said, oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
(Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
(Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
I said, oh l—

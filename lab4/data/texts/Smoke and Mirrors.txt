All I believe
Is it a dream that comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, woah
But all that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)

All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain to disappear
Dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

All I believe
Is it a dream that comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)
I want to believe, woah
But all that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)

Believe, I want to believe (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Believe

All I believe
Is it a dream that comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)
I want to believe, woah
But all that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)

I'm waking up to ash and dust
\nI wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
\nI'm breathing in the chemicals
\nUhh, ahh
\n
\nI'm breaking in, shaping up
\nThen checking out on the prison bus
\nThis is it, the apocalypse
\nWhoa
\n
\nI'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
\nEnough to make my system blow
\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age
\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age
\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
\nI'm radioactive, radioactive
\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
\nI'm radioactive, radioactive
\n
\nI raise my flags, dye my clothes
\nIt's a revolution, I suppose
\nWe're painted red to fit right in
\nWhoa
\n
\nI'm breaking in, shaping up
\nThen checking out on the prison bus
\nThis is it, the apocalypse
\nWhoa
\n
\nI'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
\nEnough to make my system blow
\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age
\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age
\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
\nI'm radioactive, radioactive
\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
\nI'm radioactive, radioactive
\n
\nAll systems go, the sun hasn't died
\nDeep in my bones, straight from inside
\n
\nI'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
\nEnough to make my system blow
\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age
\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age
\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
\nI'm radioactive, radioactive
\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
\nI'm radioactive, radioactive

'Cause I've come, I've conquered, water's parted
Now I'm here to stay
I've won, I've lost, I've paid the cost
And I'll never break
Until doomsday

We ain't never comin' downstairs
Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay
Save it for somebody that cares
Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay
Love me, hate me and make me ugly
Break me and shame me
You should see the view up here
Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay

A loaded gun up on a moonlit night
You wanna be a man that's made
You've done your wrongs, and now you feel so right
You're sweatin', but you're in the shade

'Cause I've come, I've conquered, water's parted
Now I'm here to stay
I've won, I've lost, I've paid that cost
And I'll never break, oh

We ain't never comin' downstairs
Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay
Save it for somebody that cares
Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay
Love me, hate me and make me ugly
Break me and shame me
You should see the view up here
Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay

Wake me when the circus passes under
Wake me when the pirates stop the plunder
Fortune is unfortunately volatile
Trust me that the future's looking futile (Gods don't pray)

We ain't never comin' downstairs
Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay
Save it for somebody that cares
Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay
Love me, hate me and make me ugly
Break me and shame me
You should see the view up here
Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay

Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay
Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay

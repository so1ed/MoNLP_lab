Take a look outside, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy
Take a real good look, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy

So spend your hours on
What you think I've done wrong
I know I'm in your mind
I've been here way too long
I want to spend my life
With those who've done me right
Your heart is frozen over
I'm a four-leaf clovеr

Take a look outside, it's a beautiful day, yеah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy
Take a real good look, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy

Do-do-do-do, no time for toxic people
Do-do-do-do, no time for that (I-I-I've got)
Do-do-do-do, no time for toxic people
I-I-I, I-I-I've got no time for toxic people

Move along, move along, move along, go
Let me go to the clouds below
'Cause they're calling me up to higher ground
What a teacup sound, even mighty drown, oh

Take a look outside, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy
Take a real good look, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy

Do-do-do-do, no time for toxic people
Do-do-do-do, no time for that (I-I-I've got)
Do-do-do-do, no time for toxic people
I-I-I, I-I-I've got no time for toxic people

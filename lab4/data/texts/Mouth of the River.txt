I wanna live a life like that
Live the life of the faithful one
Wanna bow to the floor
With everybody else wanna be someone
I wanna make some love
I don't want no enemies
Oh, it's the curse of the man
Always living life, living life, living just to please

Oh, the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh, the mouth of the river (Woah, now)
Oh, the mouth of the river (Woah, now)
And the wrath of the giver (Woah, now)
With the hands of a sinner (Woah, now)
Oh, the mouth of the river

Oh, I'm alkaline
I'm always keeping to the basics
I'm overboard
I'm self-destructive
And self-important
And I'm anxious
Oh, I'm self-assured
I'm nervous
And I'm pacing, oh, I'm pacing

Oh, the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh, the mouth of the river (Woah, now)
Oh, the mouth of the river (Woah, now)
And the wrath of the giver (Woah, now)
With the hands of a sinner (Woah, now)

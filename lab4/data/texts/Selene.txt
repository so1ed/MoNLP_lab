Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh, what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through the tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishin'
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is not what I expect
This is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears
And now they're crowning me the Caesar

Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh, what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishin'
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is my heart, it's on the line
This is my heart, it's on the line
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishin'
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene
